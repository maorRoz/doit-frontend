# Stack(and important libs worth mentioning)

* React
* Styled-components
* Material-ui
* TypeScript

# Run

1. execute `yarn install`
2. execute `yarn start`/`yarn dev`

# Assumptions

- I've assumed that the frontend task may reside in a separate repo. The backend task can be found in another repo
- I've assumed that the style should look more closely to the header in the first picture and not like the MacOS menu. Also I've assumed that there is no need for sections inside the menu with border lines.


# Final words
Hopefully you'll have tons of fun checking my work as it was for me during the implementation process :)
Let me know if you have any questions
